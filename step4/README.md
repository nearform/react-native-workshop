# Step 4

Objectives:
 - Add collision detection between the target and the ball
 - Trigger haptic feedback when the ball collides with the target

## Steps to get to this point

**To be fleshed out**
 1. Within the DeviceMotion listener - Use `getIsBallInTarget` to check if the ball is in the target
 2. If it is, update the shared value with a new target position
 3. And trigger haptics
